Today I'll be speaking about WordPress' template hierarchy and how to leverage it for our designs and how to make our builds modular, using the built in template structure.

Let's start with discussing some basics.

* What do I mean when, I use the word "Template"?
	- **A Template** in WordPress is a PHP theme file that determines how content is displayed.
* How can we leaverage templates?
	- First you'll need to understand the **The Template Hierarchy**
* What is the **The Template Hierarchy**?
	- **The Template Hierarchy** is a list of possible files that can be used in a theme and their relationship to each other.
	- There are two useful locations to get more information on **The Template Heirarchy**
		- ðŸ”— [WPHierarchy.com Site](https://wphierarchy.com/)
		- ðŸ”— [Template Hierarchy Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)
	- Some Examples of Templates are the following
		- `page.php` - Controls how single pages are displayed
		- `single.php` - Controls how single blog posts are displayed
		- `category.php` - Controls category archive pages
		- `tag.php` - Controlstag archive pages

Learning the what template file to use is a very important skill as a WordPress Designer/Developer. This skill will truely empower you to create custom layouts without the "need" for theme builders!
